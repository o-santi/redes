find... Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better. Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's
beautiful. And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like Well, let me put it this way,
princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think
little of him. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure
up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do
that measuring when you see him tomorrow Tomorrow It will take that long -Shouldn't we stop to
make camp -No. That would take longer. We can keep going. But there are robbers in the woods.
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good. Hey. Come on. I'm scarier
than anything we're gonna see in this forest. I need to find somewhere to camp, now! Hey, over
here. Shrek, we can do better than that. Now, I don't think this is decent for princess. No, no, it's
perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. Homey touches Like what A door. Well, gentleman I'll
be d..., good night. Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will... I said
good night! Shrek! What are you doing I just..., you know... Oh, come on, I was just kidding. And
that one, that's Throwback. The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. Right. Yeah. Hey, can
you tell my future form these stars Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories.
Look. There's Blodna, the Flatulent You can guess what he is famous for. All right. Now I know
you're making this up. No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his
stag. Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are
more than they appear. Forget it. Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back,
anyway -Our swamp -You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
We Donkey, there is no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm
gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land. You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just
now. You know, what I think I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. No,
do you think -Are you hiding something -Never mind Donkey. Oh, this is another one of those
onion things, isn't it No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things. -Why don't you want
to talk about it -Why do you want to talk about it -Oh, Why you block -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes
you are. -Donkey, I'm warning you. -Who are you trying to keep out Just tell me that Shrek. Who
Everyone, ok -Oh, now we're getting somewhere. -Oh, for 'the love of pit'. Hey, what's your
problem Shrek What do you got against the whole world anyway Look. I'm not the one with the
problem, ok It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and
go AAA... Help! Run! A big stupid ugly Ogre. They judge me, before they even know me. That's why
I'm better off alone. You know what When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Yeah, I know. So, a... Are there any donkeys up there Well, there's a Cabby. The small and
annoying. Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there That's the
moon. Again. Show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. Perfect. Yeah.
You know I like like that. Oh come on baby... -Donkey. Wake up. -What -Wake up. Morning. How
do you like your eggs -Good morning princess. -What's all this about You know, we kind of got of
to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
Thanks. Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. -Shrek! -What It's a compliment. Better out
than in I always say. But that's no way to behave in front of a princess. -Thanks. -She's as nasty as
you are. You know. You're not exactly what I've expected. Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them. Princess! What are you doing mon shery, for I am your saviour.
And I am rescuing you from this green...beast. Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own. Please,
monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are. Oh, of
course. How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men! Man, that was
annoying. Oh, you little... Shall we all the forin Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come
from -What -That. Back there. That was amazing. Where did you learn that Well, when one lives
alone one has to learn these things in case there's a... There is an arrow in your butt. What Oh,
would you look at that. Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. -What's wrong -Shrek's hurt.
-Shrek's hurt Shrek's hurt! -Oh, no. Shrek's going to die. -Donkey, I'm ok. You can't do this to me
Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep your legs elevated. Turn your head . -Does anyone
know how to handle... -Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me
a blue flower with red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue
flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! -Donkey!
-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. -What are the flowers for -For
getting rid of the Donkey. Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out. -Hey! Easy with the yanking.
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out. No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite...
-Don't move. -Ok, look. Time out. -Would you... Ok. What do you propose we do Blue flower, red
thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't
colorblind. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming! Not good.
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it. Nothing happened. We were just a... Look if you want to be
alone, all you had to do is ask, ok Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind. The princess
here was just... Au! Hey, what's that Is that... There it is, princess. -Your future awaits you. -That's
Duloc Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I
think needs, he has a I guess we better move on. Sure, but Shrek... -I'm worried about Donkey.
-What I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so good. -What are you talking about I'm fine. -Well,
that's what they always say. And the next thing you know you're on your back. -Dead! -You know
she's right. You look awful. -Do you want to sit down -You know, I'll make you up some tea. Well, I
won't say nothing, but I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see
-He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner. -I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you going Oh man, I
can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!!! I think I need a hug. This is good. This is really
good. -What is this -Wheat rat. -Rotisserie style. -No kidding. -Oh, this is delicious. -Well, they also
great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew. I guess I'll be dining a
little different late tomorrow night. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook
all kinds of stuff for you. Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it. I'd like that. -Ah... ,
princess -Yes, Shrek I'm a.... I was wondering. Are you... a... Are you gonna eat that Man, isn't
this romantic. Just look at that sunset. Sunset! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late. -What -Wait a
minute. I see what's going on here. You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you Yes, yes. That's it. That's,
I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside. But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the
dark too. Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. -Good night. -Good night. Ahh. Now I
really see what's going on here. Oh, what are you talking about. Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look,
I'm an animal and I got instincts. And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it.
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell
the fairemones. Just go in there and tell her how you feel. There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I
did tell her that... well you know. I'm not saying that I do, 'cause I don't. She's a princess and
I'm... ...an Ogre. Yeah, an Ogre. -Hey, where are you going -To get more firewood. Princess.
Princess Fiona Princess, where are you Princess It's very spooky in here and are we playing little
games. -No, no. -Help! Shrek! Shrek! -No. -Shrek! -It's ok. It's ok. -What did you do with the
princess -Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess. -It's me, in this body. -Oh my god. You ate the princess.
-Can you hear me -Donkey! Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
This is me. Princess What happened to you You're a... different. -I'm ugly, ok -Yeah. Was it
something that you ate 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea. -You are what you eat, I
say. -No. I've been this way as long as I can remember. What do you mean Look, I've never seen
you like this before. It only happens when the sun goes down. By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss. Then, take love's true form... -Oh, that's
beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry. -It's the spell. When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell
on me. Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast. I was placed in a tower to await the day
when my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the
sun sets and he sees me, like this All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not
that ugly. Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 247.
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look. Princess. How about if
you don't marry Farquaad I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. But you know,

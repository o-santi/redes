runner up will take his place. And so on, and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm
willing to make. Applause. Let the tournament begin. What is that? Ugh, it's hideous. Oh, that's not
very nice. It's just a donkey. Indeed. Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named
champion. How about him. Oh, hey. Now, come on. Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All
right then. Come on. Hey Shrek! Let me, let me! The chair! Give him the chair! Thank you. Thank
you, very much. I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel! Shall I give the order sir? No. I have a better
idea. People of Duloc. I give you our champion! What? Congratulation, Ogre. You've won the honor
of embarking on a great and noble quest. Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp
back! -Your swamp? -Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures. Indeed. All
right Ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back. Exactly
the way it was? Down to the last slime covered toast tool. -And the squatters? -As good as gone.
What kind of quest? Ok, let me get this straight! We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with
full of freaks on the first place. -Is that about right? -You know what? Maybe there is a good reason,
donkeys shouldn't talk. I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know, ??? . Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick. Oh, you know
what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate. Got a knife, cut
open their spleens and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? A, no, not really, no. For
your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think. -Example. -Example? OK, A-a-m,
Ogres are like onions. -They stink? -Yes, no. -O, they make you cry. -No. Oh, you leave them out on
the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs? No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres
have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. O, you both have layers. You
know not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers. I don't care
what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. You know what else everyone likes? Paffe. Have you
ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is
delicious. No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden. Ogres are like onions. End of story.
Bye, bye. See you lather. Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. You
know I think I've preferred your humming. Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a
mess. Just the word paffe has made me start slimying Why, Shrek, did you do that? Man you got to
warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was opened and everything. Believe me
donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Yeah, right,
brimstone. Don't be talking ??? brimstone. I know what I smell and ??? no brimstone. And they
don't come of stone neither. Sure it's big enough, but look at the location. Oh, Shrek, remember
when you said that Ogres have layers? Oh, yeah. Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't
have layers. We wear ??? sleeves. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. -You know what I
mean. -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs. No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a
rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava! Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok? For
emotional support. We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time. -Really?
-Really really. Ok. That makes me feel so much better. Just keep moving and don't look down.
Don't look down, don't look down. Shrek! I'm looking down! I can't do this. Just let me off right now,
please. -But you're already half way. -Yeah, but I know that half is safe. Ok, fine. I don't have time
for this. You go back. Shrek, no, wait. Don't do that! Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? -Oh. This? -Yes, that!
Yes, yes. Do it. OK. -No, Shrek! -I'm doing it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do. Cool. So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her. I was talking about the dragon Shrek. -Are you afraid? -No, but
shhhhh. Oh, good. Me neither. Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Here's a...,
something responsible of the situation. Not to mention dangerous situation. And there's dragon that
breathes fire. I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I
mean. I'm sure he's heavier than a cow... Donkey. Two things. Ok? Shut, up. Now go over there and
see if you can find any stairs. Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess. The princess will be
up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. What makes you think she'll be there? I read it
in a book once. Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs. Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???.
That's right. Those stairs won't know which way they go. The drafting stairs, ??? Don't mess with
me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs. I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd
step all over it. Well, at least we know where the princess is. -But where is the... -Dragon! Donkey,
look out! Got you. Oh, what large teeth you have. I mean, white sparkling teeth. You probably hear
this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you
got there. And do I detect the hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're a girl
dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon, 'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty
out. What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye? Man, I'd really love to stay,
but you know I'm a asthmatic and I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke
and stuff. Shrek! No, Shrek! Shrek! -Wake up! -What? Are you princess Fiona? I am. Awaiting a
knight so bold as to rescue me. Oh, that's nice. Now let's go. But wait, sir knight. This be our first
meeting. Should not be wonderful, romantic moment? Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time. Hey, what
are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet. Out through the window and down
the rope by to your valued steed. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? Uh-um. But we
have to sing through this moment. You can residing of a poem to me. A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti.
Or something. I don't think so. Well, can I at least know a name of my champion? Shrek. So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Thanks. -You didn't slay the dragon? -It's
not my job to do this. Now, come on! But this isn't right. ??? That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame. That's not the point. Wait. Where are you going? Exit is
over there. Well, I have to save my ass. What kind of knight are you? One of a kind. ...rush into a
physical relationship. I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude. That was
the word I was looking for. Magnitude. Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you
doing? Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time. I mean, we really should
get to know each other first, you know what am I saying. As friends, maybe even as ??? Hey don't
do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail. And you're going to tear it off.... Oh, no. No! -It
talks?! -Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick. Ok, you two. Head for the exit. I'll take care of the
dragon. Ruuuuun! You did it. You rescued me. Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ... ...a little
unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt. And where
would a brave knight be without his noble steed. I hope you heard that. She called me a noble
steed. She thinks I'm a steed. The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight. -Aah,
no. -Why not? I have helmet hair. Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer. Oh, no, you
wouldn't, dust. But, how will you kiss me? What? That wasn't in a job description. -Maybe it's a
perk? -No. It's destiny. You must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a
dragon is rescued by a brave knight. And then they share true love's first kiss. With Shrek? You
think, wait... ...you think Shrek is your true love? Well, yes. You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny? Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok? Of course you are. You're my rescuer. Now,
now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. -Just take off the helmet. -I'm
not going to. -Take it off! -No! -Now! -Ok, easy. As you command your highness. You're an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Well, yes, actually. Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not
supposed to be an Ogre. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok? He's the one,
who wants to marry you. Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me? Good question. You should
ask him that, when we get there. But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some Ogre and
his pet. Well so much for noble steed. Look princess. You're not making my job any easier. Well I'm
sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me
properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? -I'm a delivery
boy. -You wouldn't dare. -You coming donkey? -Put me down! Yeah, I'm right behind you. Put me
down or you will suffer the consequences. This is not dignified. Put me down. Ok, here's another
question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you
let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt? But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How
do you do this? Just tell her, she's not your true love. Everyone knows it what happens when you
